bind-restapi
A quick and simple RESTful API to BIND, written in Python/Tornado. Provides the ability to add/remove entries with an existing BIND DNS architecture.

Based on the work of https://github.com/ajclark/bind-restapi Rewritten with Python and Tornado. To daemonize, daemon.py is used: http://www.jejik.com/articles/2007/02/a_simple_unix_linux_daemon_in_python

Instructions
$ Customize defines inside bind-restapi.py
$ python bind-restapi.py start
Add a record to DNS:
$ curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-Api-Key: secret' -d '{ "hostname": "host.example.com", "ip": "1.1.1.10", "ptr": "yes", "ttl": 86400}' http://localhost:9999/dns
Remove a record from DNS:
$ curl -X DELETE -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-Api-Key: secret' -d '{ "hostname": "host.example.com"}' http://localhos    t:  9999/dns
API
The API supports POST and DELETE methods to add and remove entries, respectively. On a successful POST a 201 is returned. On a successful DELETE a 200 is returned. Duplicate records are never created.

The API can reside on a local or remote DNS server.

On a POST request, the API adds both the forward zone and reverse in-addr.arpa zone entry ONLY if {"ptr": "yes"} is specified.

On a DELETE request, the API removes both the forward zone and reverse in-addr.arpa zone entry as a connivence

The TTL, portand other DNS params are hard-coded inside of dns.rb

TTL can be overriden from the request with {"ttl": "$TTL"}

Security
The API is protected by way of an API-Key using a custom X-Api-Key HTTP header. The API should also be served over a secure connection.
