OSX (mac) computer.


1. Download the pdf_list.sh script and put it in the folder where your PDFs are. 
You'll have to extract the zip file. Alternatively, just copy and paste everything in "pdf_list.sh"
into a text file (not a word document, I think on the mac it is called textedit or notepad?)

2. Open the Mac "Terminal" application. If you hit âŒ˜-space and type "term" it will show up in your search bar.

3. type "source " including the space and do not hit enter

4. Click and drag the script file into the Terminal window. The location of the script should appear 
after source, for instance on my machine:
"source /home/dan/code/bash/jdr_script/pdf_list.sh"

5. hit enter. It should create a CSV listing all of your files in the same folder the script and PDFs are in. 
Excel can open CSVs, it should ask if you want to import and you just say OK.
pdf_list.sh
#! /bin/bash

location="."
#default location (IE, where to look for pdfs, default is where ever you saved the code file, abbreviated as ".")

#code below will create files_list.csv, list files in that folder, add them to rows in the csv if they end in pdf or rtf
touch files_list.csv; ls $location | awk 'BEGIN { FS="[.|-]"; OFS=","; \
print "Author,Title,Tags,Format" } \
/.*.(pdf|rtf)$/ {print $1, $2, $3, $4}' > files_list.csv
