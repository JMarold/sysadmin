Description of Question
Hello
I need to connect from the python script to salt-cloud and create a virtual machine from the specific salt-cloud profile and on-the-fly override any parameters that was define.
I need to connect from a Python script to salt-cloud to create a virtual machine with a specific salt-cloud profile and on-the-fly override any settings that have been defined.

I couldn't found any examples in the docs.
I found and watched two create methods in Cloud and CloudClient classes and did not see where I can use the specific profile.

Can you give me an example of python salt-api code, please?

You are going to want to use the profile function, not create.

Then you can specify the vm_overrides to specify per instances extra information

Thanks,

Thanks very much for your advice!
Then I have this profile:

windows-ci:
  extends: windows
  provider: vcenter
  folder: build_agents
  datastore: QA&RD-DevOps
  power_on: True

  grains:
    role: windows-ci

  num_cpus: 4
  memory: 8GB

  devices:
    disk:
      Hard disk 1:
        thin_provision: False

  minion:
    master: devops-ci-master
And now i can deploy any VMs from python by overriding any parameters in this profile:

>>> import salt.cloud
>>> import pprint
>>> spec = {'devices':{'disk':{'Hard disk 1':{'size': 50}}}, 'clonefrom': 'template_Windows_7_x64'} 
>>> pprint.pprint(spec)
{'clonefrom': 'template_Windows_7_x64',
 'devices': {'disk': {'Hard disk 1': {'size': 50}}}}
>>> client = salt.cloud.CloudClient(path='/etc/salt/cloud')
>>> out = client.profile('windows-ci', names=['test-win01'], vm_overrides=spec)
...
Please tell me, how can I have the output log information in python as if to run a console command:

# salt-cloud -l info ...

You will need to pass 'info' to salt.log.setup.setup_console_logging and then the cloud client will log to the console when you run the command.
