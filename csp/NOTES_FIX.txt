cspheader.php has a typo

header($contentSecurityPolicy);

should be

header($headerCSP);

or rename $headerCSP to $contentSecurityPolicy

This "code" does not work. $HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA is undefined

@AkinOlawale Look at http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.httprawpostdata.php

Warning: This feature was DEPRECATED in PHP 5.6.0, and REMOVED as of PHP 7.0.0.
...
In general, php://input should be used instead of $HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA.

Try this instead

$requestContent = file_get_contents("php://input");
$data = json_decode($requestContent, true);
And please avoid PHP' shorttags <? .... They are official discouraged see here.

There are several issues with this code...
As mentioned in other comments already variable $headerCSP is named incorrectly, as header() expects variable $contentSecurityPolicy, then $HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA is deprecated and needs to be replaced with file_get_contents("php://input"); in php > 7, apart from that

$message.="<b>Blocked URI:</b> ".$data['csp-report']['blocked_uri']."<br/><br/>";
$message.="<b>Violated Directive:</b> ".$data['csp-report']['violated_directive']."<br/><br/>";
$message.="<b>Original Policy:</b> ".$data['csp-report']['original_policy']."<br/><br/>";
needs to be replaced with

$message.="<b>Blocked URI:</b> ".$data['csp-report']['blocked-uri']."<br/><br/>";	    
$message.="<b>Violated Directive:</b> ".$data['csp-report']['violated-directive']."<br/><br/>";
$message.="<b>Original Policy:</b> ".$data['csp-report']['original-policy']."<br/><br/>";
(note the '_' are turned into '-')

otherwise these fields will be empty in the generated email.
